				gexif does not indirectly store any image data, unless specified to do so. All image processing occurs on-device, and any data stored
				is immediately destroyed after exif processing is complete. gexif may temporarily store cookies or javascript files on your device,
				however these files are deleted after use.

				<strong>gexif does NOT store any GPS data</strong>. Some images may have GPS data embedded in them, but gexif does not store this data.
				gexif only stores a temporary image blob, and as said in the first statment is automatically deleted after processing. gexif also does not
				sell any image data to 3rd parties, or display advertisments on the site (and never will - ads suck.)

				If you have any questions or you believe that any data is stored on the server, please don't hesistate to reach out at hello@blockarchitech.com
